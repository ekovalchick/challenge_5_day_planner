# challenge_5_day_planner
Description
The motivation of this project is to utilize jquerey elements to create a planner for a busy employee. I built this code to enhance my technical knowledge of jquery. This code solved the problem of needeing a planner that saved your events even after the website is reloaded. My biggest lesson from this project is to always utilize time-efficient methods when using javascript to create shorter and simpler code. 

Table of Contents (Optional)

Usage
This website provides a user friendly daily planner that will show past hours in grey, current hour in red and upcoming hours in green and will self update. The planner will also save the information locally. This saved data will still be on the file even after the website is reloaded.

Credits
This code was provided by the UM bootcamp. I revised the code to make it more user-friendly and accessable.

Tests
Test can include changing your timezone on your device to see if the colors of the hour blocks will change. You can also wait and check the colors as the day goes on. Also, insert information in the description areas, save, inspect, and see the local storage of the information. Reload the page and the information will still be there.
